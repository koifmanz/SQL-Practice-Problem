# SQL Practice Problem 

Here my Solutions for Sylvia Moestl Vasilik's book *'SQL Practice Problems'*. 
Originally the problems are in MS SQL Server and MySQL. I personally prefer PostgreSql, so I migrate the data from the sql server version. 
There an issue with the some of the dates columns (I created date instead of timestamp), which I will need to fix.

You can found the book on her site [sql practice problems](https://sqlpracticeproblems.com/) or on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Practice-Problems-learn-doing-ebook/dp/B01N41VQFO).
