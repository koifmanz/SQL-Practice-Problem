# SQL Practice Problem 
### by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik

Here my Solutions for Sylvia Moestl Vasilik's book "SQL Practice Problems". 
Originally the problems are in MS SQL Server and MySQL. I personally prefer PostgreSql, so I migrate the data from the sql server version. 
There an issue with the some of the dates columns (I created date instead of timestamp), which I will need to fix.
